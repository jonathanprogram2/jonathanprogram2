# 👋 Hi there, I'm Jonathan Mirabal!

I’m a frontend developer and AI-in-finance enthusiast passionate about building tools that feel futuristic, purposeful, and beautifully designed.

My work blends intelligent automation, Web3 innovation, and immersive user experiences. I’m currently building **Obel**, a visual crypto research platform powered by AI and real-time Web3 data, and **Focus Pocus**, a productivity app designed to support users with ADHD through smart nudges, routines, and gamified insights.

Whether I’m designing animated interfaces or integrating backend systems, I care deeply about combining **functionality with creativity**, and bringing bold ideas to life through code.
