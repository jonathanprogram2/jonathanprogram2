## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are a few projects I’m proud of:

1. **Conway's Game of Life**
   - 📌 Repository: https://github.com/FullSailGameStudies/conway-s-game-of-life-08-24-jonathanprogram2.git
   - 🖍️ Description: A simulation of Conway's Game of Life, demonstrating logic and visualizations in coding.

2. **Bricks Breaker**
   - 📌 Repository: https://github.com/FullSailGameStudies/bricksbreaker-chris-jonathanprogram2.git
   - 🖍️ Role:
      - Replaced a solitary brick object with a **vector of 5 bricks**, evenly spaced across a single row.
     - Updated `Game::Render` and `Game::CheckCollision` to manage and check collisions for all bricks in the vector.
     - Introduced a **collision response system**: bricks are removed from the vector after 3 collisions.
     - Added **win and lose conditions**:
       - **Win Condition:** If no bricks remain, the game pauses, and "You win! Press ‘R’ to play again" is displayed.
       - **Lose Condition:** If the ball touches the bottom of the window, the game pauses, and "You lose. Press ‘R’ to play again" is displayed.
